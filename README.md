##Project Overview

This project automates the review, categorization, and payment calculation of monthly radiologist exam reports. It was built in **three stages**:

1. **Jupyter Notebook Prototype**  
   - Initial logic for data extraction, categorization, and payment calculation was developed and tested in a Jupyter Notebook.
   - Focused on proving the workflow and validating results with real data.

2. **Python Script Packaging**  
   - Once the logic was validated, the notebook was converted into a `.py` script to make it easier to maintain, reuse, and scale.

3. **Streamlit Web Application**  
   - To make the tool accessible to non-technical team members, a Streamlit app was developed.
   - This app allows users to:
     - Upload monthly Excel reports
     - View categorized summaries and payout totals live
     - Download the updated report with two new sheets:
       - **Pay Summary**
       - **Detailed Exams**

This development workflow demonstrates my ability to:
- Prototype solutions quickly in Jupyter Notebooks
- Refactor and package code into production-ready Python scripts
- Build self-service web applications for non-technical users using Streamlit
